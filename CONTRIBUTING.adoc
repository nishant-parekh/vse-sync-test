== New tests

A new test must provide a test specification and reference implementation. It
must conform to the repository layout and file content requirements.

== Modified tests

Changes to published test behaviour cannot be accepted. This includes any change
to a test specification procedure or a reference implementation. However, a new
test with new test behaviour can be accepted.
